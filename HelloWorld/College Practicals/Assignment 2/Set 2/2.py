# 2.2 Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors
# of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into
# another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

def divisor(number):
    for i in range(1, number+1):
        if number % i == 0:
