# 7.1 Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then
# generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to
# ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate. (Hint: The Fibonacci
# sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the
# previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

            fibonacciSeries[1] = 1
